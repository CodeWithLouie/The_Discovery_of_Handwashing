# The Discovery of Handwashing

This project explores the impact the introduction of hand washing had on the death rate of hospitals in Dublin, Vienna, and Rotunda.

## Analysis Carried-Out

1. Feature Engineering
2. Summary Statistics
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Data Visualisation

The code of this analysis is available in the **handwashing.ipynb** file. All codes are written in the R language. You can also download the **Handwashing.pdf** file to get a quick glimpse as what was what carried if you don't want to bother with the code.


## Insights Gained

According to the analysis, the average deaths in Vienna was significantly higher before handwashing was introduced and lower afterwards. Conversely, death rate was significantly higher when autosy was introduced.

Additionally, doctors and midwives worked in **clinic_1** and only midwives worked in **clinic_2**. From the data, it can be seen that the average death was significantly higher in **clinic_1** compared to **clinic_2**. This tells us that doctors who performed autopsies and other forms of surgeries without washing their hands carried the bacterial into the delivery room resulting in a higher mortality count (this data is supported by the spike in death rate when autopsy was introduced).

Unfortunately, Dr. Semmelweis did not get the acknowledgement he deserved before his death. However, his finding has continued to save millions of lives till today.
